This code is a C++ program designed to interact with Windows processes and user privileges.
, allowing the user to impersonate another process to gain higher levels of access.

Here is a summary of what the main components of the code do:

Check for elevated privileges: The program first checks to see if it is running with elevated privileges. Elevated privileges are necessary for many system-wide operations, such as modifying other processes or accessing specific system resources. If the program does not run with these privileges, it outputs an error message.

Impersonate Process: The program then allows the user to enter the process identifier (PID) of another running process. When the user provides this PID, the program attempts to open that process and obtain its token.

Token Duplicate: After obtaining the security key, the program duplicates it to create a new token that can be used for impersonation.

Launch a new process: Finally, the program uses the duplicate token to launch a new instance of PowerShell. This new instance runs with impersonation process permissions,
